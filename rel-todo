o Rama and Rota graphs validation graphs have terrible scaling - difficult to fix :: 4

o Have a look at contact dots during refinement - with the 3a3a say, there is hang, and the
  final refined structure is shown - there is no animation :: 2

o Have a look at the poly-TRP problem of sequence identification. :: 4

o  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
   Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
   Solved now? Am I using the right version?
